/**
 * What a glyph's body is showing.
 *
 * A manifestation with chrome and an empty body is three different things —
 * still loading, nothing to show, or a failure nobody heard — and until this
 * list existed the element said none of them. An empty box was read as whichever
 * of the three the reader guessed.
 *
 * So emptiness is declared rather than inferred, the way `manifestation.ts`
 * declares which manifestation a glyph is in. The states are a closed set for
 * the same reason that one is: a name off the list is a word, not a state.
 *
 * `refused` is not `error`. docs/sentry.md: "A refusal that the node is designed
 * to answer with is neither [Error nor Warn] — it is Info, and it is the node
 * working." A body that never arrived is the node not working, and it is shown
 * where it happened, because logging alone is hiding (web/ts/market-glyph.ts).
 */

/**
 * Every state a glyph's body can be in, and whether it is done moving.
 *
 * `settled` is what the watcher dispatches on: a body still `pending` past its
 * deadline is the failure this list exists to name. Written as a literal
 * `true`/`false` rather than `boolean` so a caller can narrow on it.
