/**
 * Whether a glyph's body ever arrived.
 *
 * A morph commits geometry and mounts content afterwards, so there is a state
 * the Morph Axioma does not admit: committed, and incomplete. Chrome on the
 * screen, nothing under it, nothing thrown, nothing logged — a window that is
 * a title bar and 16px of padding, which no test could fail and no error could
 * name because no error existed.
 *
 * This watches the one place that gap opens: between mounting a body and the
 * body drawing. A body that draws is `present` and the watch ends. A body still
 * showing nothing when its deadline passes is `refused`, and it says so where it
 * happened, in the box where the content should have been — logging alone is
 * hiding (web/ts/market-glyph.ts).
 *
 * Scope: a window or panel opened from a tray dot mounts through
 * forms/render-content.ts, and a glyph lifted off the canvas mounts
 * through forms/canvas-window.ts. Both arm the watch, so both are
 * covered — they are two constructors for the one `window` row, and saying
 * "every window" without saying which constructor is how they drifted in the
 * first place. Not covered: `workspace` (forms/canvas.ts renders
 * straight into the viewport), `canvasPlaced`, and host glyphs that build their
 * own content area. They call `declareContent` or they are not covered.
